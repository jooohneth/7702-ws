### 1. `src/lib/client.ts` setup

<Callout type="info">
In this demo, we will be using a "Relay Account" (not the EOA) to execute the Transaction. This is typically how EIP-7702 is used in practice, as the relayer can sponsor the gas fees to perform the Transaction.
However, it is also possible for the EOA to sign and also execute the Transaction.
</Callout>


```ts
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http, Hex } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { eip5792Actions } from "viem/experimental";

const relayPrivateKey = import.meta.env.VITE_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY;

if (!relayPrivateKey) {
  throw new Error(
    "VITE_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY is not set in the environment variables."
  );
}

export const relayClient = createWalletClient({
  account: privateKeyToAccount(relayPrivateKey as Hex),
  transport: http(),
  chain: sepolia,
}).extend(eip5792Actions());

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: sepolia,
  transport: http(),
});
```

Quick brief: 
  - `relayClient` is used to call functions on our EOA / Embedded Wallet.
  - `publicClient` is used to read data from the chain.
  - `eip5792Actions` is experimental and not yet stable, but allows to have EIP-7702 compatible transactions.
  - we're going to be sending txs on ethereum `sepolia` testnet, since it has 7702 enabled.


We export these components to later use in `App.tsx`.
