<Callout type="warn">
    Note: don't deploy production code where you're using client side environment variables, 
    like in our case `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID`, this is just for demo purposes.
</Callout>


### 1. `src/lib/config.ts` setup

The only config we're using for this simple project is the Privy config that will then be passed into the `PrivyProvider` component.

```ts
if (!import.meta.env.VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID) {
  throw new Error("VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID is not set in the environment variables.");
}

export const privyConfig = {
  appId: import.meta.env.VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID,
  config: {
    embeddedWallets: {
      showWalletUIs: false,
      createOnLogin: "all-users",
    },
  },
};
```

<Callout type="info">
    Note: `createOnLogin: "all-users"` means that all the connected users will have embedded wallets created for them automatically.
    This is important since we rely on the embedded wallet to act as our EOA that would be enhance with code.
</Callout>

### 2. `src/lib/main.tsx` setup

This would be our main entry point for the app, and we want to wrap the app in the PrivyProvider component. 

```tsx
import { PrivyProvider, PrivyClientConfig } from "@privy-io/react-auth";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <PrivyProvider
    appId={privyConfig.appId}
    config={privyConfig.config as PrivyClientConfig}
  >
    <App />
  </PrivyProvider>
);
```

Should be it for our `main.tsx` file, let's move on to the next section.
