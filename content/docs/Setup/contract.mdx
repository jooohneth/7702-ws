### 1. Deploy Contract

First and foremost, we must deploy a contract with the source code of which we want to enhance our EOA with.
In our case, it's a going to be a very simple batch execution contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Delegate {
    struct Call {
        bytes data;
        address to;
        uint256 value;
    }

    function execute(Call[] calldata calls) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
            Call memory call = calls[i];
            (bool success, ) = call.to.call{value: call.value}(call.data);
            require(success, "call reverted");
        }
    }

    fallback() external payable {}
    receive() external payable {}
}

```

For simplicity, i'll asusume you know how to deploy this contract on Ethereum Sepolia, I suggest using one of these tools: 
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

OR 

if you just wanna quickly go through this and not mess around with contracts, you can use my already [deployed contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF98F5336b4a6fdcD4bB620e00cF66Ef8101949E1#code)


### 2. `src/lib/contract.ts` setup

We gotta fill in the details like abi and address of the contracts that we're interacting with from our frontend. 


<Callout type="info">
    Note: the MNT contract details are already added, you don't need to modify that. 
    As well as the Delegate contract's abi, assuming you're using the same contract code as me. 
</Callout>

After updating the Delegate contract's address, you should have a structure like this:

```ts
export const MNTContract = {
  address: "0x64ad5bc6ce7b02be1d9970ae9296b4e4480ed1e1",
  abi: [
    {
      inputs: [
        { internalType: "address", name: "to", type: "address" },
        { internalType: "uint256", name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
      ],
      name: "mint",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [
        { internalType: "address", name: "to", type: "address" },
        { internalType: "uint256", name: "value", type: "uint256" },
      ],
      name: "transfer",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "bool", name: "", type: "bool" }],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ],
};

export const DelegateContract = {
  address: "0xF98F5336b4a6fdcD4bB620e00cF66Ef8101949E1",
  abi: [
    { type: "fallback", stateMutability: "payable" },
    { type: "receive", stateMutability: "payable" },
    {
      type: "function",
      name: "execute",
      inputs: [
        {
          name: "calls",
          type: "tuple[]",
          internalType: "struct Delegate.Call[]",
          components: [
            { name: "data", type: "bytes", internalType: "bytes" },
            { name: "to", type: "address", internalType: "address" },
            { name: "value", type: "uint256", internalType: "uint256" },
          ],
        },
      ],
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "payable",
    },
  ],
} as const;

```

Once that's finished, we should be good to move forward.
