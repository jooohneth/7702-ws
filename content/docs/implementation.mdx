title: Implementation
description: Jumping straight into the code.

Let's open up the `App.tsx` file and see what's up.

<Callout type="info">
    Ignore the UI components defined below the `App` component, those are not relevant to the functionality of the workshop.
</Callout>

To be fair, you can ignore most of the code in this file since it's primarily UI code for us to track the states,
but the `App` component is where the logic happens. 

Specifically, in these three functions:

```tsx
  const onAuthorize = async () => {};

  const onUnauthorize = async () => {};

  const onExecute = async () => {};
```

As you might have guessed by the name of these functions, they are going to be used to:
- Sign an authorization to use the source code of our delegate contract.
- Remove an authorization signed by the embedded wallet.
- Execute a batch transaction that would 
    1. Mint 100 MNT tokens to the embedded wallet.
    2. Send 10 MNT to the mock account.

Let's see how we can implement these functions.

### 1. `onAuthorize`
```tsx
  const onAuthorize = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);

    // (Optional) Get the nonce of the relay client
    const nonce = await publicClient.getTransactionCount({
      address: relayClient.account.address as Address,
    });

    // (Optional) Hash the authorization
    const authorizationHash = hashAuthorization({
      contractAddress: DelegateContract.address as Address,
      chainId: sepolia.id,
      nonce: nonce,
    });
    setAuthorizationHash(authorizationHash);

    // (Important) Sign the authorization using the embedded wallet
    const signedAuthorization = await signAuthorization({
      contractAddress: DelegateContract.address as Address,
      chainId: sepolia.id,
    });

    // Store it in the state to be used when executing the tx in `onExecute`
    setAuthorization(signedAuthorization);

    setIsLoading(false);
    toast.success("Authorized");
  };
```

Quick brief:
- Getting the nonce is optional, but may be useful to understand. 
- Hashing the authorization is also optional, but might be useful for debugging.
- Signing and storing the authorization is the most important part,
without it the relay client won't be able call functions on our embedded wallet.

<Callout type="info">
    Note: the `signAuthorization` function is a helper function from Privy that allows to sign the authorization using the embedded wallet. 
    Also, obtained through the `useSignAuthorization` hook.

    ```tsx
        import { useSignAuthorization } from "@privy-io/react-auth";

        const { signAuthorization } = useSignAuthorization();
    ```

</Callout>

### 2. `onExecute`

```tsx
  const onExecute = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);

    // (Optional) Verify the authorization
    const valid = await verifyAuthorization({
      address: embeddedWallet?.address as Address,
      authorization: authorization as Authorization,
    });
    if (!valid) {
      toast.error("Invalid authorization");
      setIsLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    // (Important) Execute the transaction
    const tx = await relayClient?.writeContract({
      abi: DelegateContract.abi, 
      address: embeddedWallet?.address as Address, // the "contract" we're calling is the embedded wallet
      functionName: "execute",
      args: [
        [
          // First tx: Mint 100 MNT to the embedded wallet
          {
            data: encodeFunctionData({
              abi: MNTContract.abi,
              functionName: "mint",
              args: [embeddedWallet?.address as Address, parseEther("100")],
            }),
            to: MNTContract.address as Address,
            value: 0n,
          },
          // Second tx: Send 10 MNT to the mock account
          {
            data: encodeFunctionData({
              abi: MNTContract.abi,
              functionName: "transfer",
              args: [mockAccount, parseEther("10")],
            }),
            to: MNTContract.address as Address,
            value: 0n,
          },
        ],
      ],
      authorizationList: [authorization!], // the authorization we signed in `onAuthorize`
    });
    setTxHash(tx);

    // (Optional) Wait for the transaction receipt
    const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash: tx,
    });
    setTxReceipt(receipt);

    // (Optional) Get the source code of the embedded wallet
    publicClient
      .getCode({ address: embeddedWallet?.address as Address })
      .then((res) => {
        setSourceCode(res as Hex);
      });

    setIsLoading(false);
    toast.success("Success");
  };
```

Looks like a lot, but the majority of the code is optional. 
Here's the important stuff:
- We're using our `relayClient` to call the `execute` function on the embedded wallet.
- During the tx, the embedded wallet is "enhanced" with the source code of the `DelegateContract`,
since we're specified the `authorizationList` parameter.
- The sequence of execution is as follows:
  1. The relay client will call the `execute` function on the embedded wallet.
  2. The embedded wallet calls the `mint` function on the MNT contract.
  3. The embedded wallet calls the `transfer` function on the MNT contract.
- All of this is also done gaslessly, since the gas is covered by the relayer 
(Abstracted for the end user)

### 3. `onUnauthorize`

```tsx
    setIsLoading(true);

    // (Important) Sign the authorization using the embedded wallet 
    const signedAuthorization = await signAuthorization({
      contractAddress: zeroAddress,
      chainId: sepolia.id,
    });

    // (Optional) For the source code to be removed immidiately, we have to send a redundant tx
    const tx = await relayClient?.sendTransaction({
      authorizationList: [signedAuthorization],
      to: embeddedWallet?.address as Address,
    });

    // (Optional) Wait for the transaction receipt
    const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash: tx,
    });
    setTxReceipt(receipt);

    // (Optional) Get the source code of the embedded wallet
    publicClient
      .getCode({ address: embeddedWallet?.address as Address })
      .then((res) => {
        setSourceCode(res as Hex);
      });

    setIsLoading(false);
    toast.success("Unauthorized");
```

Quick rundown:
- We're signing an authorization using the embedded wallet.
- We're sending a redundant tx to remove the source code of the embedded wallet immidiately.

<Callout type="info">
    Note: we're setting the address of the source code contract to be the `zeroAddress`, 
    which basically means removing the source code.

    Also, the funny part is that for the modification to be reflected immidiately, 
    we have to send a redundant tx with the `authorizationList` parameter set to the signed authorization.
