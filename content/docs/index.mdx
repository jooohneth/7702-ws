### What is this workshop?

In this workshop, we'll explore how to build a very simple starter app that allows users to:
- authenticate with an X account (this could be extended to any social account)
- enhance their EOA with the functionality of sending batch transactions.
- send transctions gaslessly using a relayer.

The code that allows us to do this is super minimalistic and easy, thanks to the tools: 

- [Viem](https://viem.sh)
- [Privy](https://privy.io)

### What are we building?

The program itself will just mint a bunch of MNT Tokens on Sepolia, and airdrop them to a random wallet all within a single batch transaction without the embedded wallet needing to have gas ETH, nor have an EOA wallet for that matter, thx to social login and embedded wallets.
