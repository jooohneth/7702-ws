## What is EIP-7702?

EIP-7702 is a proposal to introduce a new transaction type (SET_CODE_TX_TYPE, 0x04) that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily or permanently delegate their behavior to a smart contract, effectively turning any EOA into a smart account. This is achieved by letting an EOA specify a *delegation designator*-a special code pointing to a smart contract implementation. When active, any transaction sent to the EOA will execute the code at the designated contract address, but the EOA's address remains the `msg.sender`.

> "EIP-7702 enables EOAs to delegate control to smart contract accounts that can execute code directly from their addresses. It is compatible with the prevailing AA standard, ERC-4337, so existing wallets can become smart contract wallets without creating a new address and transferring assets."

## Key Features & Use Cases

- **Transaction Batching**: Combine multiple operations (e.g., token approval + swap) into a single atomic transaction, improving UX and reducing gas costs.
- **Gas Sponsorship**: Allow third parties or apps to pay transaction fees for users, or enable users to pay gas in ERC-20 tokens instead of ETH.
- **Permission Management**: Assign sub-keys with restricted capabilities (e.g., only interact with certain dApps, limit spending to a daily quota, etc.).
- **Session Keys & Account Recovery**: Enable temporary session keys for smoother dApp interactions and easier account recovery flows.
- **Seamless Migration Path**: Unlike previous proposals, EIP-7702 is fully compatible with ERC-4337, enabling existing EOAs to gain smart wallet features without changing addresses or migrating assets.

## How Does EIP-7702 Work?

- The EOA signs a special authorization message to delegate execution to a smart contract.
- This authorization is included in a transaction, updating the EOA's delegation designator (`0xef0100 || address`).
- As long as the delegation is active, transactions to the EOA execute the smart contract code at the specified address.
- To revoke, the user sends another EIP-7702 transaction to reset the delegation.

## Security Considerations

- **Entrusted Contract Security**: The smart contract code must be thoroughly audited to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Signature Verification**: Correctly verify user signatures to avoid unauthorized actions.
- **Replay Protection**: Implement nonce or other mechanisms to prevent replay attacks.

## Timeline

| Date        | Event/Update                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| May 2024    | Vitalik Buterin introduces EIP-7702, quickly gaining positive feedback from the community. |
| Q3 2024     | Refinement phase: Proposal evolves to store a contract address, not full code, for flexibility.|
| Q1 2025     | EIP-7702 is scheduled for inclusion in Ethereum's Pectra hardfork, likely March or April.|
| Now         | Developers can experiment with EIP-7702 on testnets (e.g., Ithaca's Odyssey, Sepolia).           |

## Why Does EIP-7702 Matter?

EIP-7702 represents a major step toward Ethereum's vision of *account abstraction*, making onchain experiences more flexible, user-friendly, and secure. By bridging EOAs and smart contract accounts, it enables powerful new features-batching, gas sponsorship, permissioned keys-without requiring users to migrate wallets or assets.
